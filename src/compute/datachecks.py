"""Consistency checks between independent datasets in the predictor stack.

If the inputs are sound, physically related quantities from *different*
sources must agree. Each check reports a rank correlation (Spearman rho) over
the land cells both datasets cover, and the direction physics predicts.
Deterministic; no model involved.
