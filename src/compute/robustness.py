"""How much do the results depend on uncertain inputs?

Two deterministic analyses (fixed random seed, so repeated calls agree):

Uncertainty (Monte Carlo)
    Target values are measurements or editorial classes with unknown error bars.
    Each used target value is perturbed with Gaussian noise whose standard
    deviation is a fraction of that criterion's scoring range, set by the
    target's own stated confidence (see ``NOISE``). For every run the whole Earth
    is re-scored; a site's *stability* is the share of runs in which it stays in
    the top 1% of land cells.

Sensitivity (leave one criterion out)
    For each active criterion, re-score with its weight set to 0 and report the
    validation ROC-AUC and the new top site. A result that survives dropping
    any single criterion does not hinge on one dataset.
